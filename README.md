# Dockerized Fullstack Javascript environment.

## Use

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose run

or docker-compose up --build
```

Expect the Build phase to take longer the first time as it pulls the full (almost 1GB) node image, subsequnt builds should be much faster.

## Testing

Frontend

- _localhot:3002_

Backend

- _localhost:3001_
