# Dockerized Fullstack Javascript environment.

## Installation

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose run
```

Or

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Expect the Build phase to take longer the first time as it pulls the full (almost 1GB) node image, subsequnt builds should be much faster.

## Run application

Frontend

- _localhot:3002_
